                <p>How can exercise help relieve psychological stress?  How can technology and design help people who hate sports reduce their resistance to sports?</p>
                <p>
                CarrotCarrot is a mobile game that aims to help users develop healthy habits and relieve psychological stress through light fitness.  Unlike other fitness apps that can be stressful or overwhelming for people who are inactive or resistant to movement, CarrotCarrot provides a unique approach that combines data visualization, gamification, and simulation elements to encourage users to engage in light exercises at their own pace.</p>

                    <p>The game is designed for couch potatoes or users who need encouragement to start their fitness journey. A user who feels hopeless about losing weight may also be motivated by using the app to see the concrete result transformed from the effort on fitness. Users will control RabbitRabbit to run a farm and gain coins from every movement in daily life.  Users can also trigger and watch different working animations through exercises like hoeing the ground or planting crops.  The coins can unlock more rabbit working animations, buy different crops, and upgrade the farm buildings.  In later stages of the game, users can also purchase rabbit skins and other decorative items with coins.</p>

                    <p>The game’s unique point of view is not to push users to exercise but to encourage users to develop healthy habits and stick to them naturally.  CarrotCarrot provides a non-judgmental environment that allows users to set their own light goals and feel accomplished and rewarded for their progress.  The various animations of the rabbit character make the exercise process less tedious and stressful. CarrotCarrot’s simulation elements provide a tangible way for users to see their progress and stay motivated without the stress of setting specific exercise goals or finishing a to-do list.</p>

                    <h2>Concept</h2>

                    <p>The two-sided nature of the cradle makes it a symbol of the sense of security and insecurity brought by discipline. The video's three scenes are derived from the cradle's functions and the general scene. Through the nine-grid brainstorming method, I got the shopping cart and office chair as an incarnation of the cradle in other representative everyday scenes. In addition, I used a symbol throughout the video as a clue of discipline in the three stages -- <strong>the forbidden symbol.</strong></p>

                    <p>The virtual world of CRADLE in the video included three places where people are regularly disciplined. The first place is the baby room (human beings are the product of discipline from birth). In supermarkets, values are sold, freedom of choice is backed by an inescapable net, and every human choice is counted. We often think that our decisions to buy things are based on our own needs, but most of our desires are driven by the manipulation of capital. Invisible eyes stare at us in the office, the manager, colleagues, and clients, and the rule of the adult world continue strangling us. A cubicle office is like a panoramic prison.</p>

                        We are all living in a CRADLE.

                        Conventional taboos are invisible chains controlling everyone. 
                        We live but cannot live as ourselves.

                        CRADLE shows a visual sense of being misinterpreted and shielded.
