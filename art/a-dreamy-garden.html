                    This is the journey of Explorer No.6 in a dream space. This virtual environment is an exhibition of my Zoom university life. The time conflict between living time and natural time will discuss the meaning and definition of time. The time zone difference forces lots of students to have classes and live in a different time zone from the local one. The time conflict changes people’s lives and creates lots of typical problems. I hope the project can help people feeling as stressed about the irregular schedule and the difficulty of Zoom university as me to take a rest and calm down.
                </p>

                    The purpose of this project is to communicate the idea of time and extraordinary life in the pandemic. Players are supposed to walk through space and read the story from the virtual objects and the setting. By controlling Explorer No.6, the avatar of the player, the player can visit different times in my life in space. The dreamy garden is a space for people to calm down, take a rest, stay awhile, read, and consider. The interaction here is a more mental one instead of a physical one. By reading my story, the player may feel comfortable and light to know that someone feels the same as them though their difficulties may not be fully understood in reality.
